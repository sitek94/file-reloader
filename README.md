# live reload ðŸ¤–

Super simple WebSocket based live reloading. 

## You most likely don't need this ðŸ™ˆ

This is purely for learning purposes, so if you're looking for something solid, there are many
sophisticated solutions out there, e.g.
- [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server)

## What's going on?

When you run `npm start` two servers spin up
 - HTTP server - serves static files and inject the live reload script, which by the way is 
   extremely simple. All it does, is it triggers page reload whenever it receives a message from the 
   WebSocket server.
 - WebSocket server - watches the files in `app` directory and sends a message to client WebSocket 
   whenever a file is changed.
